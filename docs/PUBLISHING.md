# Publishing

`report:html` writes a static site to `output/web/`:

```
output/web/
  index.html            forwards to the newest report
  archive.html          every report, newest first
  manifest.json         run history: dates, counts, what was new
  favicon.ico           icons for browsers and iOS home screens
  apple-touch-icon.png  (regenerate with scripts/make-icons.mjs)
  2026-09-24/
    report.html         the daily briefing
    member-<name>.html  one page per member
    party-<name>.html   Republicans, Democrats, Independents
```

Any static host works. The rest of this page covers the setup this repo ships with: S3 and CloudFront on AWS, and a daily scheduled run.

## AWS hosting

`cloudformation.yaml` creates a private S3 bucket, a CloudFront distribution in front of it, an IAM user that can only publish, and optionally an ACM certificate and Route 53 record for your own domain. Deploy it to `us-east-1`, because CloudFront only uses certificates from there.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --stack-name congress-trades \
  --template-file cloudformation.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides BucketName=<globally-unique-bucket-name>
```

For your own domain, add `CustomDomain=trades.example.com HostedZoneId=<route53-zone-id>` to the overrides.

Copy the stack's outputs into `.env`:

```
S3_BUCKET=<BucketName output>
AWS_REGION=<Region output>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AccessKeyId output>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SecretAccessKey output>
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID=<DistributionId output>
```

The secret key is only shown in the outputs of the first deploy. If you lose it, rotate the key in IAM.

Then publish:

```bash
node --env-file=.env dist/index.js report:html --publish
```

That fetches new filings, reruns the analysis, regenerates the site, syncs `output/web` to the bucket (uploading changed files and deleting ones that are gone), and clears the CloudFront cache. Useful variations:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `report:html --publish --skip-unchanged` | Stops early when the fetch found nothing new. What the scheduled run uses |
| `report:html --render-only --publish` | Rebuilds today's pages from the last saved analysis, after a design change say |
| `report:html --rebuild-index --publish` | Rebuilds only `index.html` and `archive.html` |

## Daily run on Windows

`run-and-publish.ps1` runs `report:html --publish --skip-unchanged` and logs to `logs\congress-trades-YYYY-MM-DD.log`. Filings are only posted on business days, so schedule it Monday to Friday. In PowerShell as Administrator, adjusting the path and time:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction `
  -Execute "powershell.exe" `
  -Argument '-NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\uniquetrades-congress\run-and-publish.ps1"' `
  -WorkingDirectory "C:\path\to\uniquetrades-congress"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday -At "7:00AM"
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -StartWhenAvailable

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Congress Trades - Daily Report" `
  -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings -RunLevel Highest
```

`-StartWhenAvailable` runs it as soon as possible if the computer was off at the scheduled time.

## Docker

`docker/Dockerfile` builds the CLI into a Node 22 image, and `docker/compose.yaml` runs it the same way as `run-and-publish.ps1`. From the repo root:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml build
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml run --rm congress-trades                       # fetch, OCR, report, publish
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml run --rm congress-trades ocr:catchup --limit 5  # any other command
```

- **Settings** come from the repo's `.env` if there is one.
- **Data** persists across runs: `data/`, `reports/`, `output/`, `formatted-reports/` and `logs/` are mounted from the repo, so the container and a native install share the same cache.
- **Ollama**: `OLLAMA_URL` defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`, the Ollama on the Docker host (this works on Linux too). Set `OLLAMA_URL` and `OLLAMA_API_KEY` in your shell or in `docker/.env`, not the repo's `.env`. Compose gives those priority because the repo's `.env` usually points at `localhost`, which inside a container is the container itself.

```bash
OLLAMA_URL=https://ollama.example.com OLLAMA_API_KEY=secret \
  docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml run --rm congress-trades
```

Without compose:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t uniquetrades-congress .
docker run --rm --env-file .env -e OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 \
  -v "$PWD/data:/app/data" -v "$PWD/reports:/app/reports" -v "$PWD/output:/app/output" -v "$PWD/logs:/app/logs" \
  uniquetrades-congress report:html --skip-unchanged
```
