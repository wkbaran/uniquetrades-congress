# FMP Sector/Industry to Committee Mapping

This document explains how FMP's sector and industry taxonomy is mapped to congressional committees for the "committee relevance" scoring factor.

## Overview

- **FMP Sectors**: 11 total
- **FMP Industries**: 159 total
- **Sectors Used**: 10 (91%)
- **Industries Used**: 68 (43%)

The discrepancy exists because not all industries have clear congressional committee oversight. We only map industries where there's a direct regulatory or legislative relationship.

## Sectors
